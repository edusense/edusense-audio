# EduSense: Practical Classroom Sensing at Scale

![hero image](media/hero.png)

[EduSense](https://www.edusense.io/) represents the **first real-time, in-the-wild evaluated and practically-deployable  classroom sensing system at scale** that produces a plethora of theoretically-motivated visual and audio features correlated with effective instruction.

Our [getting started](doc/getting_started.md) is a good starting point if you are interested in building/developing/deploying EduSense. More information about the team can be found on the [EduSense website](https://www.edusense.io/team).

## News

- *Oct 2019* We open-source our EduSense code!
- *Sep 2019* We presented our paper titled "Edusense: Practical Classroom Sensing at Scale" at Ubicomp'19.
